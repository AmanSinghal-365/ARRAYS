VECTOR:: DYNAMIC ARRAY...SIZE NOT FIXED
BASICS FILE HAS A STATIC ARRAY ONLY... ARRAY WAS ALREADY DEFINED...
#include<vector>
SYNTAX::
vector<data type> vector name;

THE DEFAULT SIZE IS 0...
WHENEVER VECTOR FILLS, IT DOUBLES IT'S SIZE...
EXAMPLE::
vector<int>arr(10,20,30); //3 elements stored in vector 10 20 30
vector<int>arr(10,-1); //10 elements stored where each is -1

int n;
cin>>n;
vector<int>arr(n);
arr.push_back(5); //insert elements
arr.pop_back();  //removes last element
arr.size();   //gives size of vector...no of elements
arr.empty();   //empty or not
arr.capacity();  //max space available currently

ARRAY VS VECTOR
size is pre-defined in arrays we can't add more elements...
vector doubles its size when it becomes full...

ALL ARRAYS CONCEPTS CAN BE USED IN VECTORS...
LIKE INDEXING...

VECTORS AND FUNCTION:::
let's say we have 2 vectors a and b
function name is fun
WHERE IT IS CALLED???... fun(a,b);
WHERE IT IS DEFINED... void fun( vector<int> a, vector<int> b) {  } 


#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //CREATING VECTOR
    vector<int> arr;
    //SIZE:: NO OF STORED ELEMENTS
    cout<<"SIZE : "<<arr.size()<<endl;
    //CAPACITY:: MAXIMUM AVAILABLE SPACE CURRENTLY
    cout<<"CAPACITY : "<<arr.capacity()<<endl;
    //INSERTION
    arr.push_back(5);
    arr.push_back(6);
    //PRINTING VECTOR
    cout<<"ELEMENTS OF VECTOR IS :  ";
    for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
    {
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
    //REMOVING 
    arr.pop_back();
    //RE-PRINTING
    cout<<"ELEMENTS OF VECTOR AFTER REMOVING IS :  ";
    for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
    {
        cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
 
    //NEW VECTOR
    //DEFINED THAT IT HAS 10 ELEMENTS
    //ALL WILL BE ZERO
    vector<int> brr(10);
    //PRINTING VECTOR
    cout<<"ELEMENTS OF VECTOR WHEN INITIALIZED... ELEMENTS ARE :  ";
    for(int i=0;i<brr.size();i++)
    {
        cout<<brr[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
    //INIALISING EVERY ELEMENT WITH -5
    vector<int> crr(10,-5);
    //PRINTING VECTOR
    cout<<"ELEMENTS OF VECTOR WHEN INITIALIZED (-5)...ELEMENTS ARE :  ";
    for(int i=0;i<crr.size();i++)
    {
        cout<<crr[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
    //DYNAMIC INPUT FROM USER ABOUT NO OF ELEMENTS WITH -5
    int n;
    cout<<"ENTER NO OF ELEMENTS: ";
    cin>>n;
    vector<int> drr(n,-2);
    cout<<"ELEMENTS OF VECTOR WHEN INITIALIZED (-2) USER DEFINED NO. ELEMENTS...ELEMENTS ARE :  ";
    for(int i=0;i<drr.size();i++)
    {
        cout<<drr[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
    //VECTOR CREATION NEW WAY...no use mostly
    vector<int> err{1,2,3,4};
    //PRINTING VECTOR
    cout<<"ELEMENTS OF VECTOR IS:  ";
    for(int i=0;i<err.size();i++)
    {
        cout<<err[i]<<" ";
    }
    cout<<endl;
    //EMPTY OR NOT
    cout<<"EMPTY OR NOT LAST VECTOR : "<<err.empty();
    
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT::
SIZE : 0
CAPACITY : 0
ELEMENTS OF VECTOR IS :  5 6 
ELEMENTS OF VECTOR AFTER REMOVING IS :  5 
ELEMENTS OF VECTOR WHEN INITIALIZED... ELEMENTS ARE :  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
ELEMENTS OF VECTOR WHEN INITIALIZED (-5)...ELEMENTS ARE :  -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 -5 
ENTER NO OF ELEMENTS : 3
ELEMENTS OF VECTOR WHEN INITIALIZED (-2) USER DEFINED NO. ELEMENTS...ELEMENTS ARE :  -2 -2 -2 
ELEMENTS OF VECTOR IS :  1 2 3 4 
EMPTY OR NOT LAST VECTOR : 0
